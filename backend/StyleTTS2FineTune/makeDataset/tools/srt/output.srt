Bladder diverticula are pouches or sacs that form in the wall of a hollow organ and push through the outer muscle lining. Thus, bladder diverticula are outpouches that develop in the urinary bladder. Also called vesicle diverticula, these outpouches most commonly occur among older men. They also

00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:35,925
develop in babies, in which case they are usually due to congenital malformations. Typically, increased internal pressure, such as may occur when the bladder is overextended with urine, results in the development of one or more outpouches. However, there are two different types of bladder

diverticula. acquired, which develop in older people and are caused by urinary retention, chronic bladder infections or other stresses on the bladder, and congenital, which are caused by an abnormality in fetal development. Both types are more common in males than in females. In rare instances

the diverticula are related to hereditary disorders. In this disease the connective tissue that holds cells together is defective resulting in weakened organ walls and other structural problems throughout the body. The most common diagnostic test entails direct examination of the bladder

interior via a cytoscope. This is a hollow tube that is inserted into the urethra and extended into the bladder. Special viewing devices allow the doctor to examine the bladder and a scissors-like attachment can be used to collect tissue samples. A large diverticulum may show up on x-rays. Other

possible diagnostic studies include CT scanning, in which a computer uses multiple X-ray images to create a cross-sectional view of an internal organ, in this instance, the bladder. Ultrasonography, in which high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of an internal organ. Gas may be

injected into the bladder to provide greater contrast and make the outpouches more apparent. If a bladder diverticulum is detected in an adult, it should be biopsied because many of these outpouches have been found to harbor cancer. If the diverticula are benign and are small, they may not require

treatment.
